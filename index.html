<p>I finished high school in 2010. After university I spent 5 years doing special effects for movies and 3D animations for museums. After which I wanted change and started programming. Learning was hard though. Now after 8 years of software development and 7 years of teaching it, I've decided to put my experience to good use and build Tinkr - so learning to code would suck less.</p>
